## Simulate an expert

Ask ChatGPT to play the part of a customer, co-host, or talented expert.

  

Have a conversation with it, or ask it to generate content as if it were that specific persona.

  

```plain

## Challenge the conventional narrative

Ask for examples of what contradicts the dominant narrative.

  

Generate content that challenges readers' assumptions.

  

Seek out provocative angles that defy expectations and break the mold.

  

```plain
Topic: Growing your email newsletter

For the above topic, give examples that contradict the dominant narrative. Generate an outline for thought-provoking content that challenges assumptions.
```

* * *

## Use unconventional prompts

Try using prompts that are more open-ended or abstract.

  

This way you’ll get unique and creative responses nobody else is.

  

By getting weird, you can unlock ChatGPT's creative potential in finding vivid language and unexpected topics.

```

* * *

  

## Ultra-Brainstormer

It’s easy to have ChatGPT generate a list of potential topic ideas for your next project.

  

But often they're generic and expected.

  

Instead, ask it to come up with new angles or approaches to cover a familiar topic.

```plain
Topic: How to double your creative output. 

For the topic above, brainstorm new angles or approaches. Prioritize ideas that are uncommon or novel.
```

* * *

  

## Capture your writing style

Feed ChatGPT your writing.

  

Ask it to help you create a style guide for future outputs.

  

It’ll give you the exact words to describe your voice and tone in a way that AIs understand.

Ask ChatGPT it to work according to good advice you've read elsewhere.

  

In the prompt below, I take some tips on persuasive writing from the Grammarly blog and ask it to apply them to my topic.

```

## Have ChatGPT write from different perspectives

Ask it to write from the perspective of a group of characters with different backgrounds or viewpoints.

  

Explore new ideas and perspectives, and add depth to your writing.

• Chunks of text of less than 280 characters

• Using the structure: 1) What, 2) Why, 3) How

  

```plain
Create a mind map on the topic of using Notion to stay organized as a content creator, listing out the central idea, main branches, and sub-branches.
```

* * *

  

## Generate content with a specific purpose or goal in mind

Tell ChatGPT who your audience is and what you want to achieve with your content.

  

Remember, it has no context about who you are or what you want unless you give it some.

  

So give it context.

  

```plain

For audience: Business coaches
Content goal: Motivate audience to feel excited about growing their business while teaching them one tip.
Writing style: Clear, concise, conversational, down-to-earth, humble, experienced

Oh, and have a little fun creating truly unique content in the process.
